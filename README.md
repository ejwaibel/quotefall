# quotefall

If you enjoy solving cryptograms, acrostics or crossword puzzles, you'll love solving Quotefall! The game is simple. Each puzzle contains a hidden quote, with the spaces for each letter in that quote laid out in a typical crossword puzzle-type black and white grid. Above each column are a series of letters. Simply "drop" each letter into the appropriate squares in each row and column to reveal the hidden quote, as you'll see in the example puzzle below:
